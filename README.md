# FirstSpawn

FirstSpawn is a verified discovery node for voxel-based multiplayer communities. The platform provides a reliable infrastructure for finding servers based on performance data and verified uptime, rather than paid placements.

## Core Principles

- Verified Discovery: We prioritize real player retention and verified performance.
- Integrity: Our systems are designed to block fake votes and provide transparent metrics.
- Reliability: Uptime is tracked in real-time to ensure discovered communities are accessible.

## Features

- System Verified: 100% of fake votes are blocked.
- Real-time Uptime: Verified server availability tracking.
- Advanced Filters: Pure discovery powered by active bot filters.
